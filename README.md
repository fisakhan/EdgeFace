Face Recognition on the Edge
This repository provides a complete solution for AI based real-time Face Recognition on edge devices.

## Edge Devices
Edge devices are hardware components that operate on the "edge" of a network, processing data closer to where it is generated rather than sending it to a centralized server or cloud. These devices often handle tasks like data collection, processing, and decision-making locally, which can reduce latency, improve efficiency, and enhance data privacy.
### Key Characteristics of Edge Devices
Local Processing, Real-Time Decision-Making, Bandwidth and Latency Reduction, Data Privacy and Security.
### Common Examples of Edge Devices
IoT Devices, Smart Cameras, Raspberry Pi or Other Microcontrollers, Drones (with edge processing, drones can analyze images, detect obstacles, or identify objects in real-time during flight), Smartphones and Tablets.
### Applications of Edge Devices
Healthcare, Manufacturing, Retail, Autonomous Vehicles.
### Why Edge Devices Matter
Edge devices play a key role in edge computing, a growing field aimed at optimizing data processing and network efficiency. By reducing dependency on cloud servers and central processing hubs, edge devices help enable faster, more responsive, and secure systems across various industries.
